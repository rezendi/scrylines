The Scryline Manifesto
----------------------

Our world has fragmented into a kaleidoscope. As 2020's pandemic and election
show, what we once thought of as "the news" has splintered into a bewildering
panoply of different sources. Real understanding of a complex topic often
requires assembly from an cornucopia of traditional media articles, online
upstarts, scientific studies, legal documents, experts / pundits on Twitter,
eyewitness YouTube clips, Medium posts, Substack essays, Reddit threads, and
more.

"But surely the job of journalism is to make sense of all this!" you cry.
Yes... theoretically... but journalism as we know it suffers from a number
of flaws which make it unsuitable for this sort of synthesis:
* Journalists are generally loath to link to their competitors.
* They're often even surprisingly reluctant to link to primary sources.
* They still have a "dead tree" attitude towards articles -- that they are
individual and self-contained, and that once published they are set in stone
but for corrections -- rather than treating them as connected nodes in a
network of living documents.
* The open-source concept of incorporating suggestions from strangers into
their articles after publication is unthinkable anathema.
* Aggregation of others' articles is considered inferior and low-class work.

Scryline is built on the precept that aggregation is not just potentially
illuminating synthesis which can be important and valuable in its own right;
rather, in today's fragmented media world, it is increasingly _essential_ in
order to provide key context and foster real understanding.

There are of course many ways to aggregate multiple articles. The most obvious
and intuitive one is an _annotated timeline_, in which articles are arranged
in simple chronological order, and annotated with brief commentary. Scryline
is a home for annotated timelines.

Scryline is also built atop _open data_. Its timelines are stored as YAML, a
human-readable data-serialization format, in GitHub repos. A single common
public repository is used by default, but it is also possible to use one's own
public or private repos. As such, Scryline's data is always accessible to its
users/creators, even if Scryline itself were to perish; is automatically
available, with complete version histories, via GitHub's rich API; and is
easily transferable to other services such as GitLab.
